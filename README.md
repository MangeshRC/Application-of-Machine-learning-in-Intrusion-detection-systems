With the start of the 21st Century, we have seen tremendous growth in technology. One of the major reasons for this progress has been improved and reliable computer connectivity. But with the increase in connectivity there is a threat of network attacks which can harm, steal and misuse the data from users. Intrusions or attacks can be defined as a set of events which are able to compromise the security of computer systems. Thus, it is necessary to create and maintain an infrastructure which can detect and prevent such attacks in order to protect the end users. For this purpose, Network firewalls were designed to detect and prevent such attacks but with advancements in networking technologies, firewalls cannot detect modern attack environments and are not able to analyze network packets with their network characteristics.


With the consideration of limitations in firewalls, this implementation proposed and tested the application of Machine Learning in Network Intrusion Detection with the help of UNSW-NB15 dataset which was collected as a research at Cyber Range Lab of The University of New South Wales, Canberra.
